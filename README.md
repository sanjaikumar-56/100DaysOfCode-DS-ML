# 100DaysOfCode-DS-ML
I am learning data analytics and machine learning. This is my daily log.

## My goals
- Learn Python and SQL basics
- Do small projects and notes every day
- Build a portfolio I can show later

## Day 1
- Created this repository and wrote the README.
- Goal for tomorrow: add a small Python script.

## How to use this repo
I will add notebooks, scripts, and notes here. Each day I will save my work and write what I learned.

## Day 2: Hello World in Python
- Learned how to create my first code file.
- Wrote a simple program to print "Hello, World!".

## Day 3: Simple Calculator in Python
- Learned how to take input from users.
- Built a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
- Handled an error (cannot divide by zero).

## Day 4: Star Pattern using Loops
- Learned about **for loops** in Python.
- Created a pyramid star pattern.
- Understood how nested loops work.

## Day 5: Learning Python Lists
- Learned how to create and use **lists**.
- Practiced adding and removing items.
- Used **for loops** to print all items.

## Day 6: Learning Functions in Python
- Learned how to define and call **functions**.
- Created three functions: `greet`, `add_numbers`, and `check_even_odd`.
- Practiced using **return** and **parameters**.

## Day 7: Calculator Using Functions
- Rebuilt the calculator using **functions** for cleaner code.
- Practiced using multiple return statements.
- Improved understanding of function-based design.

## Day 8: Learning Python Dictionaries
- Learned how to store data in **key-value pairs**.
- Practiced adding, updating, and removing items.
- Used a **for loop** to print dictionary keys and values.

## üóìÔ∏è Day 9: Python Tuples
- Learned what tuples are ‚Äî similar to lists, but **immutable** (cannot change once created).
- Practiced creating tuples, accessing items, unpacking values, and using tuple methods.
- Understood difference between **lists (mutable)** and **tuples (immutable)**.

### üßæ Example Code
```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits)
(a, b, c) = fruits
print(a, b, c) '''

## Day 10: Learning Python Sets
- Learned about **Sets**, which store **unique and unordered elements**.
- Practiced adding, removing, and checking items.
- Learned key **set operations** like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

### üßæ Output:
Original Set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
After adding 6: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
After removing 3: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Intersection: {3, 4}
