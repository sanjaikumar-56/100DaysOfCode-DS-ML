- Practiced creating tuples, accessing items, unpacking values, and using tuple methods.
- Understood difference between **lists (mutable)** and **tuples (immutable)**.

## Day 10: Learning Python Sets

- Learned key **set operations** like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

### 🧾 Output:
Original Set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
After adding 6: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
After removing 3: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Intersection: {3, 4}

# 🐍 Day 11 - Python Sets

## 🔹 What I Learned
- Sets are **unordered**, **unindexed**, and **unique** collections.
- They automatically remove **duplicates**.
- Sets are **mutable**, but elements must be **immutable** (like numbers, strings, tuples).
- Python also has an **immutable version** called `frozenset`.

## 🧩 Set Operations
| Operation | Symbol | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| Union | `A | B` | Combines all unique elements |
| Intersection | `A & B` | Finds common elements |
| Difference | `A - B` | Elements in A but not in B |
| Symmetric Difference | `A ^ B` | Elements not common to both |

## 🧾 Day 12: Python Strings (Basics & Methods)

- Learned how to create and manipulate strings.  
- Practiced indexing, slicing, and string concatenation.  
- Used built-in string methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`, `.split()`, `.join()`, `.find()`, and `.count()`.  
- Understood that strings are immutable in Python.  

## 📅 Day 13: Python String Formatting (f-strings, format, %)

- Learned how to display data neatly using **f-strings**, **.format()**, and **% formatting**.  
- Practiced adding variables and numbers inside text.  
- Used alignment and precision control for professional-looking output.  

 ## 🚀 Day 14 - Python Dictionaries

### 🔹 Topics Covered
- Creating and accessing dictionaries
- Adding, updating, and deleting items
- Looping through key-value pairs
- Checking for key existence
- Dictionary length and iteration

### 🧩 Summary
Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs and are mutable. They are useful for mapping relationships between data, such as storing student details, configurations, or object-like data in Python.

## 🚀 Day 15 - Python Conditional Statements

### 🔹 Topics Covered
- if, elif, and else statements
- Nested if statements
- Comparison and logical conditions
- Decision-making based on conditions

### 🧩 Summary
Conditional statements allow Python programs to make decisions and run code only when certain conditions are true. They are essential for logic control and flow in any program.

## 🚀 Day 16 - Python Loops

### 🔹 Topics Covered
- for loop
- while loop
- range() function
- break and continue statements

### 🧩 Summary
Loops help in executing a set of statements multiple times.  
- **for loop:** Iterates over a sequence (like list or range).  
- **while loop:** Repeats as long as a condition is true.  
- **break:** Stops the loop.  
- **continue:** Skips the current iteration.

## 🌟 Day 17 - Nested Loops and Pattern Printing

### 🔹 Topics Covered
- Nested loops
- Using `for` loops inside another loop
- Star pattern printing

### 🧩 Summary
Nested loops help us work with multiple levels of repetition.  
They are commonly used to create patterns, handle 2D data, and nested structures.  
Today’s practice included printing square and triangle star patterns.

## 🔁 Day 18 - Loop Control Statements

### 🔹 Topics Covered
- break
- continue
- pass

### 🧩 Summary
Loop control statements help you manage the flow of loops:
- **break:** stops the loop when a condition is met  
- **continue:** skips the current iteration and moves to the next one  
- **pass:** does nothing — used as a placeholder to avoid syntax errors  

These are helpful for adding conditions and controlling loop behavior in real programs.

## 🧠 Day 19 - Python Functions (Part 1: Basics & Parameters)

### 🔹 Topics Covered
- Function definition (`def`)
- Parameters and arguments
- Return statement
- Default parameter values

### 🧩 Summary
Functions allow you to group reusable pieces of code.  
They make your programs modular and easy to understand.  
Today’s practice focused on creating simple functions, passing arguments, and returning values.

## ⚙️ Day 20 - Python Function Arguments (Part 2)

### 🔹 Topics Covered
- Positional arguments  
- Keyword arguments  
- Default arguments  
- *args (variable-length arguments)  
- **kwargs (keyword variable-length arguments)

### 🧩 Summary
Today’s session focused on writing flexible functions using different argument types.  
You learned how to:
- Use **positional** and **keyword** arguments for clear parameter passing.  
- Handle any number of arguments using **\*args** and **\*\*kwargs**.  
These are extremely useful in real-world coding and API development.

## ⚡ Day 21 - Lambda Functions and Map, Filter, Reduce

### 🔹 Topics Covered
- Lambda (anonymous) functions  
- map(), filter(), and reduce() functions  
- Functional programming concepts in Python

### 🧩 Summary
- **lambda:** One-line functions without a name.  
- **map():** Applies a function to every item in a list.  
- **filter():** Keeps only items that meet a condition.  
- **reduce():** Combines items into a single result (e.g., sum, product).  

These tools make your code shorter, faster, and more expressive — perfect for data processing tasks.

## 🧩 Day 22 - List and Dictionary Comprehensions

### 🔹 Topics Covered
- List comprehension basics  
- Conditional list comprehension  
- Nested list comprehension  
- Dictionary comprehension  
- Conditional dictionary comprehension

### 🧠 Summary
Comprehensions make code **cleaner, shorter, and faster**.  
They let you create new lists or dictionaries from existing data using one-line expressions.  
This is widely used in **data cleaning, transformation, and analysis**.

## 📘 Day 23 – Bias-Variance Tradeoff & Model Generalization

### 🧠 Concept Overview
The **Bias-Variance Tradeoff** explains how model complexity affects performance:
- **High Bias → Underfitting**
- **High Variance → Overfitting**
- The goal is to balance both for optimal generalization.

### ⚙️ Key Techniques
- Regularization (L1, L2)
- Cross-validation
- Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting)
- Pruning (Decision Trees)
- Early Stopping
