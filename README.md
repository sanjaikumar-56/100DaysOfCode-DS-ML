- **while loop:** Repeats as long as a condition is true.  
- **break:** Stops the loop.  
- **continue:** Skips the current iteration.

## 🌟 Day 17 - Nested Loops and Pattern Printing

### 🔹 Topics Covered
- Nested loops
- Using `for` loops inside another loop

- pass

### 🧩 Summary
Loop control statements help you manage the flow of loops:
- **break:** stops the loop when a condition is met  
- **continue:** skips the current iteration and moves to the next one  
- **pass:** does nothing — used as a placeholder to avoid syntax errors  

These are helpful for adding conditions and controlling loop behavior in real programs.

Regularization helps prevent **overfitting** by adding a penalty to large coefficients:
- **Ridge Regression (L2)**: Penalizes the sum of squared coefficients.
- **Lasso Regression (L1)**: Can shrink some coefficients to zero (feature selection).

### ⚙️ Key Techniques
- Ridge → L2 Regularization
- Lasso → L1 Regularization

ElasticNet Regression combines the strengths of **Ridge (L2)** and **Lasso (L1)** regularization.  
It helps when features are correlated and when we need both coefficient shrinkage and feature selection.

### ⚙️ Key Points
- **Alpha** → Controls regularization strength  
- **l1_ratio** → Controls the mix between L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge)  
- Prevents overfitting while retaining useful features

### 💻 Code File

- **Cross Validation (CV)** → Divides data into multiple folds for more reliable model performance estimation.

### ⚙️ Key Points
- Avoids overfitting and underfitting  
- K-Fold CV averages results from different splits  
- Helps in **model selection and hyperparameter tuning**
