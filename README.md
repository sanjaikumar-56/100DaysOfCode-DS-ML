# 100DaysOfCode-DS-ML
I am learning data analytics and machine learning. This is my daily log.

## My goals
- Learn Python and SQL basics
- Do small projects and notes every day
- Build a portfolio I can show later

## Day 1
- Created this repository and wrote the README.
- Goal for tomorrow: add a small Python script.

## How to use this repo
I will add notebooks, scripts, and notes here. Each day I will save my work and write what I learned.

## Day 2: Hello World in Python
- Learned how to create my first code file.
- Wrote a simple program to print "Hello, World!".

## Day 3: Simple Calculator in Python
- Learned how to take input from users.
- Built a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
- Handled an error (cannot divide by zero).

## Day 4: Star Pattern using Loops
- Learned about **for loops** in Python.
- Created a pyramid star pattern.
- Understood how nested loops work.

## Day 5: Learning Python Lists
- Learned how to create and use **lists**.
- Practiced adding and removing items.
- Used **for loops** to print all items.

## Day 6: Learning Functions in Python
- Learned how to define and call **functions**.
- Created three functions: `greet`, `add_numbers`, and `check_even_odd`.
- Practiced using **return** and **parameters**.

## Day 7: Calculator Using Functions
- Rebuilt the calculator using **functions** for cleaner code.
- Practiced using multiple return statements.
- Improved understanding of function-based design.

## Day 8: Learning Python Dictionaries
- Learned how to store data in **key-value pairs**.
- Practiced adding, updating, and removing items.
- Used a **for loop** to print dictionary keys and values.

## üóìÔ∏è Day 9: Python Tuples
- Learned what tuples are ‚Äî similar to lists, but **immutable** (cannot change once created).
- Practiced creating tuples, accessing items, unpacking values, and using tuple methods.
- Understood difference between **lists (mutable)** and **tuples (immutable)**.

## Day 10: Learning Python Sets
- Learned about **Sets**, which store **unique and unordered elements**.
- Practiced adding, removing, and checking items.
- Learned key **set operations** like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

### üßæ Output:
Original Set: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
After adding 6: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
After removing 3: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}
Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Intersection: {3, 4}

# üêç Day 11 - Python Sets

## üîπ What I Learned
- Sets are **unordered**, **unindexed**, and **unique** collections.
- They automatically remove **duplicates**.
- Sets are **mutable**, but elements must be **immutable** (like numbers, strings, tuples).
- Python also has an **immutable version** called `frozenset`.

## üß© Set Operations
| Operation | Symbol | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| Union | `A | B` | Combines all unique elements |
| Intersection | `A & B` | Finds common elements |
| Difference | `A - B` | Elements in A but not in B |
| Symmetric Difference | `A ^ B` | Elements not common to both |

## üßæ Day 12: Python Strings (Basics & Methods)

- Learned how to create and manipulate strings.  
- Practiced indexing, slicing, and string concatenation.  
- Used built-in string methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`, `.split()`, `.join()`, `.find()`, and `.count()`.  
- Understood that strings are immutable in Python.  

## üìÖ Day 13: Python String Formatting (f-strings, format, %)

- Learned how to display data neatly using **f-strings**, **.format()**, and **% formatting**.  
- Practiced adding variables and numbers inside text.  
- Used alignment and precision control for professional-looking output.
