# 100DaysOfCode-DS-ML
I am learning data analytics and machine learning. This is my daily log.

## My goals
- Learn Python and SQL basics
- Do small projects and notes every day
- Build a portfolio I can show later

## Day 1
- Created this repository and wrote the README.
- Goal for tomorrow: add a small Python script.

## How to use this repo
I will add notebooks, scripts, and notes here. Each day I will save my work and write what I learned.

## Day 2: Hello World in Python
- Learned how to create my first code file.
- Wrote a simple program to print "Hello, World!".
